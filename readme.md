# Mily's SMP Plugin
hey there, this is a Minecraft Plugin for 1.21.11 that adds some of the "Server theory" ideas from Untossable Salad's ["Nether Star Backed Securities are Useless. Let me explain."](https://youtu.be/Y639YNr-NaQ?si=grpZxGEdPWYA4aAf) video.
## Features
* Adds a world border to the overworld that can be crossed for an amount of time by paying an amount of wheat
  * This amount increases with every time you cross the border
  * If the time runs out, you are sent to the closest location inside the border, and are warned 10 minutes before it happens.
* Disables bonemeal on wheat
* Slows wheat growth rate
## TODO:
* Add a /msmp command that allows reloading the config, info, and help
* Maybe add a custom config api that allows comments

I have like barely any java experience so be a little gentle with your critques on my java coding skills :>
